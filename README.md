### Backend Challenge from Instituto AtlÃ¢ntico.
##
### First of all you need:
  - Java 17
  - Docker
  - Postman(or anything else you wish to send requests and get responses)
  - IDE of your preference

>[!WARNING]
>Pay attention to the instructions below.
### Images you need to pull from DockerHub.
  - ps1: *You need to be `logged in Docker` in order to be allowed to download the images of RabbitMQ and Postgres11.*
  - ps2: *Docker needs to be in `Linux version`.*
  - ps3: *The pull and installation will take place when you run:* `docker compose up --build` *however it's not time to run it yet.*

>[!NOTE]
>If you need password and some information about RabbitMQ, Postgres and API, visit a file named:*
  `application.yml`

### RUNNING
##
  - At first, do get into the main directory where docker-compose file is located and run the following command:
            
            docker compose up --build
>[!NOTE]
>What happened??? The command you have just inserted into the terminal will build Postgres11, RabbitMQ and our API on Docker.

  - If you want to run it again and the project is already built, run:

            docker compose up
